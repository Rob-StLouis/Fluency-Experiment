            For part of this experiment, music will play in the background.  This music allows us to monitor attention.
            As an attention check, you will be asked to answer some simple questions about the music.

            Please note that previous research with this music shows that it generally disrupts oneâ€™s focus and makes it feel more difficult to think.
            That is, in the decision task you are about to do, the music will make it harder to identify how much the gamble is worth to you.
